# Quantum-Brachistochrone-Impl-READ-ME-
Quantum brachistochrone problem, solving the inverse problem

Setting the quantum brachistochrone equations, and functions implementing the direct problem (choosing some initial conditions).

Moreover, we implement the inverse problem; i.e. given a final unitary operator, we set up an optimizer trying to find the initial conditions providing the desired operator
